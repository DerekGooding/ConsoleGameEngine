# PNGToSpriteEditor

As the name says. Drag and drop a PNG-File into the console and it converts it to a 6bit representation. Or create a new file.


WASD - navigate cursor

Space - set pixel in active color and brush

1/2 - select brush

3/4 - select background-color

7/8 - select foreground-color


Colors are too dark and it has trouble with yellow and brown-tones.

With 'P' a sprite-file (.txt) is created which can be used with the library.
